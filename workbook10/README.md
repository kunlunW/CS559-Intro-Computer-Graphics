### Attribution for any code you are using from someplace else:

I studies the demo code for perfroming a multi-pass rendering. 

I used some of the available textures online: 
The globe texture in ex1: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/500603314799957668/

The beach texture I used for the fake-skybox in ex2: https://www.outdoorphotographer.com/tips-techniques/nature-landscapes/photographing-the-milky-way/

The mountain texture I used for the real-skybox in ex3: https://opengameart.org/art-search?keys=skybox

The mountain texture I used for the environment in ex4: https://opengameart.org/art-search?keys=skybox

The jupiter texture I used for the enviornment in ex6: https://opengameart.org/art-search?keys=skybox


### Notes for the grader: 

ex1: I drew a globe using material property map, globe is  visible with proper lighting 

ex2: I drew a frame, with normal mapping, to show one of the drawing I did in art100. I took a picture of my window frame which has a bumpy sort of texture, and it used that picture as a texture to draw a normally-mapped sphere (left), and a bump
ily-mapped sphere (right). The difference is very obvious. 

ex3-1: I drew a globe within the fake skybox 

ex3-2: I drew the same globe within the real skybox 

ex4: I drew a reflective rectangle in a very beautiful skybox 

ex5: I added shadow effect to the flying objects

ex6: I drew a brief reflective snowman and a mini sphere circling around the snowman, and some torus knots as decoration. 




Texture I made by painting: texture of the leftmost object in ex2. A painting I drew in Art100 in summer 2018. 

Texture I found online: found in ex1, ex3, ex4, ex5, and ex6. Please refer to attribution 

Texture I made by taking a picture: the two spheres in ex2. The window frame of my room.
