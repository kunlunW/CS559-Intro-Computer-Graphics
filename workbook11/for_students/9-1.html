        <h3>Where did you get this shader?</h3>
        <p> I got it from shaderFrog.com. It is a ocean theme shader</p>
        <p>Describe and include a <a href="https://shaderfrog.com/app/?query=ocea">link</a></p>

        <h3>Explain how it works, briefly</h3>
        <p> I exported the shader, and put things in the JSON to the 
          fragment shader file and vertex shader file. Then I put the 
          uniforms to the javascript and put the texture there as well and set up
          a proper tick function. But for some reason, the shader won't load properly.
